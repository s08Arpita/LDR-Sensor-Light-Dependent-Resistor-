# LDR-Sensor-Light-Dependent-Resistor-
This project is based on the working of street light. In this project, we use LDR Sensor (Light Dependent Resistor/Photoresistor). Resistance of material of LDR Sensor decreases as the light intensity increases: in the dark and at low light levels, the resistance of an LDR is high and little current can flow through it. With the help of Arduino, we code for LDE according to intensity sense by LDR Sensor.
